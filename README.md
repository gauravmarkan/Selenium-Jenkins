This project will guide you to run your selenium project with Jenkins, also explain you about installation of Jenkins(in case you are not aware of that)


Start by downloading Jenkins on your system 
The file can be found at jenkins.io/ . Download the war file. 

Try to open the file using command prompt with command java - jar jenkins.war (filename) : This would start the Jenkins server at port 8080

if you wish to host the server at some other serve, change the command to: 
java - jar jenkins.war --HTTPport9191
